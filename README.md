# ThreeJS Starter (Basic)

A simple starter for basic ThreeJS projects. The `Application` class is the entrypoint for the ThreeJS project. This allows for extended where required quite easily and easy drag and dropping between projects.

## Debug mode

Dat.GUI and Stats.js are included, and can be triggered by adding `#debug` to the URL. I like to leave this on in production because sharing is caring!
